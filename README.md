# negation_detection_nlp

YouTube Walkthrough:

Failure to detect negations leads to poor performance in natural language processing (NLP). 

In the sentence "patient has a headache, but no fever," can machines understand that fever is an entity that is negated? The answer is yes! In this notebook, we will learn how to use python to handle negations. This is done in combination with named entity recognition.

The solution that I introduced here is NegEx, a popular negation detection tool created by Wendy Chapman. To perform named entity recognition, stanza was also introduced.
